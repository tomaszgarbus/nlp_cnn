de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .

the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism .
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not .
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option .
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
 . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
as saccharine as it is disposable .
as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .
it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt !
director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . .
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge .
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags .
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .
it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle .
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia .
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
a negligible british comedy .
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .

scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped .
this is a film living far too much in its own head .
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense .
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
the central story lacks punch .
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
holden caulfield did it better .
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter .
in the end , there isn't much to it .
it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .

ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché .
it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering .
'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates .
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire .
gets better after foster leaves that little room .
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .

dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .
now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud .
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
never comes together as a coherent whole .
miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .

 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .
[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
dreary tale of middle-class angst
it bites hard .
lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .

a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg .
woefully pretentious .
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
worthy of the gong .
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
death might be a release .
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring .
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks .
no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
 . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . "
deserving of its critical backlash and more .
no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with .
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
not once does it come close to being exciting .
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump .
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful .
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .
several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project !
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to .
 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . .
arty gay film .
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years .
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better .
on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .
odd and weird .
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement .
stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou .
alternately frustrating and rewarding .
it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr .
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
seems like someone going through the motions .
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh .
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters .
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right .
a cockeyed shot all the way .
bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
insufferably naive .
it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense .
deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story .
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .
it's everything you don't go to the movies for .
'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .
meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work .
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust .
it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
under-rehearsed and lifeless
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight .
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept .
entertaining enough , but nothing new
the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say .
the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned .
too clever by about nine-tenths .
after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future .
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .
sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle .
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
it was a dark and stormy night . . .
barely goes beyond comic book status .
we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .
this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep .
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose .
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
schindler's list it ain't .
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know .
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .
too much of the humor falls flat .
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this .
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure .
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney .
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell .
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .

reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .
lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert .
the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy .
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
 . . . irritating soul-searching garbage .
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script .
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes .
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd .
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming .
a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay .
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
most of the action setups are incoherent .
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
almost gags on its own gore .
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .
there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that .
it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish .
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .
whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes .
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
bland but harmless .
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu .
only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar .
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .
feeble comedy .
be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .
a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save .
there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
 . . . too dull to enjoy .
a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen .
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it .
[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
doesn't add up to much .
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either .
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
the stories here suffer from the chosen format .
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
a processed comedy chop suey .
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !
it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid .
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .
a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .
the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal .
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
[u]nrelentingly stupid .
beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning .
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance .
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .
amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera .
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j .

skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source .
it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster .
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .

it's exactly what you'd expect .
nothing about this movie works .
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
how do you spell cliché ?
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
this is amusing for about three minutes .
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else .
too slow , too long and too little happens .
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .
done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment .

rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks .
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
draggin' about dragons
is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care .
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites .
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately .
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . .
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men .
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny .
muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .
it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
mildly entertaining .
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic .

much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
it never rises to its clever what-if concept .
what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons .
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call .
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances .
scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
barely gets off the ground .
bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent .
meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .

an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie .
brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .

the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
generic thriller junk . teens only .

what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor .
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down .
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .
flat , misguided comedy .
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times .
the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .

this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
[a] stuporously solemn film .
i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
