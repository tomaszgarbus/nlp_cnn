for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
a picture as erratic as its central character .
entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were .
at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab .
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic .
[davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories .
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse .
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create .
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .
an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull .
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
 . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
an intriguing near-miss .
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered .
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
dramatically lackluster .
to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change .
competently directed but terminally cute drama .
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
charming , if overly complicated . . .
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
this is a truly , truly bad movie .
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating .
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right .
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original .
a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks .
 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy .
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .
there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish .
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
great story , bad idea for a movie .
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
basically , it's pretty but dumb .
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim .
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel .
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .
to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud .
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short .
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project .
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .
the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .
[a] crushing disappointment .
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
an opportunity missed .
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .
apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program .
it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .

a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette .
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't .
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ?
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it .
don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .

the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .

with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here .
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight .
too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film .
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .
this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter .
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
rashomon-for-dipsticks tale .
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .
 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .

a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about .

unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
my own minority report is that it stinks .
anemic , pretentious .
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it .
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .
lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) .
truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before .
may puzzle his most ardent fans .
it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly .
under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time .
gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh .
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
[at least] moore is a real charmer .
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake .
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible .
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen .
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here .
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame .
it's just plain boring .
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it .
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is .
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products .
while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
a half-assed film .
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise .
writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable .

flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .

the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments .
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag .
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
