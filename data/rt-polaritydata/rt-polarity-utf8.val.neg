interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations .
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs .
a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
 . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired .
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . .
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
every note rings false .
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc .
obvious
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
as steamy as last week's pork dumplings .
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .
 " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof .
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium .
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .
shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan .
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay .
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . .
despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all .
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
 . . . has virtually no script at all . . .
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
lurid and less than lucid work .
a noble failure .
a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie .
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work .
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad .
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame .
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book .
the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made .
unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart .
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you .
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .
 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .
a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life .
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience .

it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .
it's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .

devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects .
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray .
perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy .
too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
a moving picture that does not move .

philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable .

bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .
[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita .
a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made .
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .
a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story .
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .
a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .

it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .

there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser .

hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .

feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
decent but dull .
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .

as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile .
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] .
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens .
instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .

where the film falters is in its tone .
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals .
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent .
i'm just too bored to care .

there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .
 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .

the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .
k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .

certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .
 . . . a rather bland affair .
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .
kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . )
sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .
