predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
it's all surface psychodramatics . 
despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
 . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
 . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée . 
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . 
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
the movie bounces all over the map . 
these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
'[hopkins]doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it . no , even that's too committed . he gets his secretary to fax it . " 
 . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
laughably , irredeemably awful . 
complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
 . . . a confusing drudgery . 
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
 . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção . 
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
smothered by its own solemnity . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
well-meaning but inert . 
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
godawful boring slug of a movie . 
sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
more tiring than anything . 
the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
just plain silly . 
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
 . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
life is a crock -- or something like it . 
imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy .

when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else . 
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
make like the title and dodge this one . 
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
show me the mugging . 
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
[a] poorly executed comedy . 
a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
 . . . hypnotically dull . 
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
a non-mystery mystery . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
more trifle than triumph . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
 . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
don't even bother to rent this on video . 
i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
fails to bring as much to the table . 
ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
it's splash without the jokes . 
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
two-bit potboiler . 
been there done that . 
has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
 . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
 . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .

hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ?

the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
an awful snooze . 
oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
 . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
a negligible british comedy . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
the central story lacks punch . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
holden caulfield did it better . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
in the end , there isn't much to it . 
it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
never comes together as a coherent whole . 
miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst
it bites hard . 
lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
[a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
woefully pretentious . 
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
worthy of the gong . 
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
death might be a release . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
 . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
not once does it come close to being exciting . 
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
arty gay film . 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
odd and weird . 
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
seems like someone going through the motions . 
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
a cockeyed shot all the way . 
bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
insufferably naive . 
it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
under-rehearsed and lifeless
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
entertaining enough , but nothing new
the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
too clever by about nine-tenths . 
after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
schindler's list it ain't . 
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
too much of the humor falls flat . 
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
this is so bad . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
do not see this film . 
all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
 . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
 . . . really horrible drek . 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
thoroughly awful . 
when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
a chiller resolutely without chills . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
[newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun  toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
more maudlin than sharp . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
 . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
just one bad idea after another . 
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
 . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
this is really just another genre picture . 
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
at once half-baked and overheated . 
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
topkapi this is not . 
it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
it treats women like idiots . 
to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
disjointed parody . 
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
the plan to make enough into an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .

the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
the film can depress you about life itself . 
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
it's one long bore . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
 . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
'this movie sucks . '
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
throw smoochy from the train ! 
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
 . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
 . . . hokey art house pretension . 
the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
[a] slummer . 
many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
a grating , emaciated flick . 
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
banal and predictable . 
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
[evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
it tells more than it shows . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . 
the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
one of the worst movies of the year . 
i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
what an embarrassment . 
a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience . 
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
aan opportunity wasted . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
a bit too eager to please . 
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
 " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
the chocolate factory without charlie . 
van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
punitively affirmational parable . 
i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
 . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
a ragbag of cliches . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
the film's center will not hold . 
interesting , but not compelling . 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
 at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore .

one of the worst films of 2002 . 
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .

[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .

when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .

a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .

the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .

this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .

the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
nothing about it fits . 
freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher .

a little too pat for its own good . 
despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book .

involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
too silly to take seriously . 
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
stay away . far away . 
 . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
 " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .

a pretentious mess . 
an often unfunny romp .

a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .

[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable

the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .

the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .

[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .

a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .

cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .

just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
eh . 
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .

lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .

queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
a listless and desultory affair .

hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .

a well-crafted letdown . 
while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
muddled , trashy and incompetent
kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered .

the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .

an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .

this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely .

trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down .

the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
the movie gets muted and routine . 
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .

spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .

make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .

sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .

a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .

the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all .

it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .

in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
originality is sorely lacking . 
its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
a major waste . . . generic . 
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
well , it does go on forever . 
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
 " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
demands too much of most viewers . 
slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
staggeringly dreadful romance . 
it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . 
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
 . . . salaciously simplistic . 
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
 . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
grating and tedious . 
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
tends to plod . 
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
a dreary indulgence . 
what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
it's just not very smart . 
 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .

tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .

leaks treacle from every pore . 
if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making .

this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .

both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare .

the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 œ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
by-the-numbers yarn . 
a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
best described as i know what you did last winter . 
vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
[t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
not exactly the bees knees
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
 " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored . 
bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
as pedestrian as they come . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
 . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes . 
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
most of the action setups are incoherent . 
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
bland but harmless . 
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
feeble comedy . 
be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
 . . . too dull to enjoy . 
a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
doesn't add up to much . 
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
a processed comedy chop suey . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
it's exactly what you'd expect . 
nothing about this movie works . 
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
how do you spell cliché ? 
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
this is amusing for about three minutes . 
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
too slow , too long and too little happens .

all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
[a] stuporously solemn film . 
i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .

why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ?

a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
all mood and no movie . 
ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
this is no " waterboy ! " 
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .

an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times

a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson .

the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
 . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .

gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .

parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
stale and clichéd to a fault . 
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
aggravating and tedious . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
a very average science fiction film . 
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
horrible
good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
fluffy and disposible . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
shallow . 
[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
we started to wonder if  some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
contrived pastiche of caper clichés . 
cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier . 
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
very stupid and annoying . 
sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
 . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
just not campy enough
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
wishy-washy . 
the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
thin period piece . 
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
a movie to forget
rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects . 
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
mildly amusing . 
who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
shrewd but pointless . 
the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .

predictably soulless techno-tripe .

the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .

can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .

his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio .

the thrill is ( long ) gone .

the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
so-so entertainment . 
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
incoherence reigns . 
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
extremely bad . 
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
the film is flat . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
'carente de imaginación , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance , es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'
boring and meandering . 
should have been someone else-
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
just a bloody mess . 
'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
i hate this movie
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
no surprises . 
it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
woody , what happened ? 
the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
slick piece of cross-promotion . 
completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
meandering and confusing . 
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
technically and artistically inept . 
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
god is great , the movie's not . 
you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
not even the hanson brothers can save it
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
a timid , soggy near miss . 
a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
terminally brain dead production . 
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
 " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
abysmally pathetic
we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
 . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
every note rings false . 
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
obvious
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
 " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
 . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
lurid and less than lucid work . 
a noble failure . 
a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
a moving picture that does not move . 
will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
decent but dull . 
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] .

instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .

pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .

holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
i'm just too bored to care . 
 . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
drowning's too good for this sucker . 
with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .

it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .

in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
 . . . a rather bland affair . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
a dreary movie . 
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .

the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
largely a for-fans artifact . 
 . . . one resurrection too many . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !

deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .

the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .

the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .

a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics .

if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn .

a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan .

a complete waste of time .

[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
less than fresh . 
pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
clever but not especially compelling . 
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
a relative letdown . 
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
amazingly dopey . 
it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
a picture as erratic as its central character . 
entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
[davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
 . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
an intriguing near-miss . 
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
dramatically lackluster . 
to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
charming , if overly complicated . . . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
great story , bad idea for a movie . 
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
[a] crushing disappointment . 
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
an opportunity missed . 
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
my own minority report is that it stinks . 
anemic , pretentious . 
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
[at least] moore is a real charmer . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
it's just plain boring . 
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
a half-assed film . 
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
storytelling feels slight . 
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
